Appearance is concerning for malignant neoplasm versus\\nadenopathy from overlying skin malignancy. There is no\\nenhancement in the mastoid segment of the facial nerve and the\\nlesion does not appear to extend into the stylomastoid foramen.\\n\\n[**2160-7-13**] CTA CHEST\\n\\nThere are numerous filling defects within the pulmonary arterial\\nvasculature, notably in the right upper pulmonary artery\\nextending into the segmental branches. A filling defect is also\\nnoted in the left lingular branches and subsegmental branches of\\nthe left lower and upper\\nlobes. There is flattening of the intraventricular septum and\\nenlargement of the right ventricle relative to the left\\nsuggestive of right ventricular heart strain.\\n\\n[**2160-7-13**] BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND\\n\\nNo evidence of deep venous thrombosis in bilateral common\\nfemoral vein,\\nsuperficial femoral vein, and popliteal veins.

See synoptic report. One lymph node, negative for\\ncarcinoma. All other neck lymph nodes negative for carcinoma,\\nsee report.\\n\\n\\nBrief Hospital Course:\\nNEURO/PAIN: Mr. [**Known lastname 17881**] was admitted post-op from right\\nparotidectomy and right neck dissection with right abdominal fat\\ngrafting performed. His post-op pain was controlled initially\\nwith Acetaminophen and Percocet, then he was switched to PO\\nDilaudid with more adequate control achieved. Unfortunately, he\\ndeveloped some hallucinations with his pain medication on HOD#8\\nrequiring a switch to Propoxyphene, without issue. His home dose\\nof Citalopram 30 mg PO daily was resumed on HOD#7. His home dose\\nof Trazadone was held post-operatively.\\n\\nCARDIOVASCULAR: He remained hemodynamically stable immediately\\npost-operatively. We restarted his home blood pressure\\nmedication, Toprol XL 25 mg PO daily on POD#0. On HOD#1 a rapid\\nresponse/trigger was called in the AM given that the patient's\\nblood pressure was in the 70s/40s range and he complained of\\nbeing lightheaded when he attempted to stand-up or ambulate. He\\ndenied cardiac symptoms. He was placed on telemetry monitoring,\\ngiven three 500 mL fluid boluses with adequate response (blood\\npressure increased to 100s/60s). His EKG was unchanged from\\n[**2-/2160**], with some residual evidence of P-R interval elongation.\\nHis beta-blocker was discontinued due to orthostatic\\nhypotension. The medicine team was consulted to evaluate, and\\nthey agreed this was related to dehydration/orthostatic\\nhypotension.\\n\\nRESPIRATORY: The patient was extubated at the end of the\\noperative procedure and maintained his oxygen saturations\\nwithout issue. He was encouraged to use incentive spirometry to\\nprevent atelectasis or PNA. We also prescribed Albuterol nebs\\nPRN given his mild asthma history. On HOD#2, the patient acutely\\ndeveloped tachypnea to the 30s and desatted to 74% on 5L O2\\nnasal cannula, and eventually required a non-breather without\\nimprovement in his oxygen saturations. A cardiac workup revealed\\na troponin of 0.07, his EKG showed some right heart strain, and\\na CTA was obtained showing multiple pulmonary arterial filling\\ndefects compatible with acute pulmonary\\nembolus--with evidence of right heart strain and patchy\\nconsolidation at the lung\\nbases. The medical ICU resident was called to evaluate the\\npatient and accepted his care. The patient also had a CT head\\nwhich showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhaging. He was\\ngiven a loading dose of Heparin at 5000 U and a [**2149**] U/hr gtt\\nwas maintained. The patient's oxygen requirements decreased, his\\ntachypnea resolved, and he was maintained in the MICU for close\\nmonitoring and heparinized for acute PE. On HOD#3 the patient\\nhad rapid accumulation of a right neck hematoma attributed to\\nleaky vasculature in the setting of heparinization for acute PE\\ntreatment. He was intubated in preparation for the OR, and was\\nsuccessfully extubated on HOD#4 without issue. The patient was\\nagain intubated in preparation for the OR on HOD#5, in\\npreparation for a re-exploration of the right neck with hematoma\\nevacuation. He was kept intubated for airway protection and\\nsuccessfully extubated on HOD#6 without issue. He was weaned\\nfrom nasal cannula to room air on HOD#7.\\n\\nFEN/GI: Immediately post-op/extubation (from his second hematoma\\nevacuation) the patient was started on clear liquids and\\nadvanced, without issue, to regular diet as tolerated by HOD#7.\\nHe was maintained on NS @ 100 cc/hr until he was tolerating PO\\nintake and his IV was hep-locked. He had no issues with nausea\\nor vomiting. On HOD#8 he experienced some epigastric disomfort\\nmost consistent with reflux esophagitis/GERD, and he was started\\nFamotidine and TUMS/calcium carbonate. This discomfort resolved.\\n\\nGENITOURINARY: The patient had a Foley placed intra-operatively,\\nwhich was subsequently removed HOD#8 and he successfully voided\\nwithout issue. His post-labs revealed a creatinine of 0.7 which\\nremained stable. His urine output was adequate throughout his\\nhospital course. There was some note of a greenish hue of his\\nurine in the MICU around HOD#[**4-17**], which was thought to be\\nattributed to a porphyria. There was no evidence of rash or\\nabdominal discomfort which would suggest a more worrisome\\nporphyria diagnosis. His urine color restored to normal on\\nHOD#7.\\n\\nENDOCRINE: No active issues. Patient remained euglycemic.\\nSliding scale insulin was maintained while on steroids post-op.\\n\\nHEME/ID: Two right neck [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains were placed\\nintra-operatively and maintained adequate drainage until\\nheparinization on HOD#3 when he was heparinized for acute\\npulmonary emboli, at which time the output of the drains\\nincreased substantially (> 300 mL per day). Given the need for\\nanticoagulation in the setting of acute PE, the drains were\\nmonitored closely. Repeat hematocrits were checked. The\\npatient's incision initially was with mild ecchymosis at the\\nflap border, which increased minimally by HOD#3. There was no\\nevidence of hematoma, although the drains had substantial output\\nduring heparinization. On [**2160-7-13**] (HOD#3), the patient was\\ncontinued on 1400 U/hr of unfractionated heparin for acute\\npulmonary embolus. It was noted that his drains had substantial\\nsanguinous output, and that a right neck hematoma was rapidly\\ncollecting, without evidence of airway compromise. He was\\nbrought to the OR emergently on [**2160-7-13**] (HOD#3) for evacuation\\nof the right neck hematoma, after two sucessful attempts of\\nbedside hematoma evacuation (350 mL total removed) with a\\npressure dressing applied. Heparinization was continued during\\nthe OR procedure at a rate of 1400 U/hr. The patient did well\\npost-op, but was noted on HOD#5 ([**2160-7-15**]) to have increased\\noutput from both [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] necks drains once again. He again\\nreturned to the OR on [**2160-7-15**] for re-exploration of the right\\nneck with evacuation of the right neck hematoma. He had no\\ncompressive respiratory compromise during either episode of\\nhematoma, albeit the collection onset was rapid.\\nIntraoperatively, no identifiable source of bleeding was noted,\\nbut diffuse leaky vasculature in combination with heparinization\\nwas the likely etiology of the bleeding. See operative\\ndictations for details. Post-op on (HOD#6) [**2160-7-16**], the patient\\nappeared to have minimal residual serosanguinous output from\\nboth [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains, he remained intubated for 48 hours\\ngiven some intraoperative supraglottic edema. Decadron was\\nadministered post-operatively for 3 days. He was heparinized at\\na rate of 1200-1450 U/hr, without heparin boluses, for a goal\\nPTT of 50 to 70. Upon floor transfer, the medicine team was\\nconsulted to assist in management of the acute PE and\\nheparinization. PTT draws were performed Q6-8 hours, and\\nadjustments to the heparin gtt were maintained. On HOD#9 his\\nheparin gtt was discontinued. Coumadin 5 mg PO daily was\\nadministered on HOD#8 and HOD#9, at which time his INR was\\nmaintained in the 2.0 to 3.5 range, with a goal of [**1-15**].5. On the\\ndate of discharge, HOD#11, the patient was given Coumadin at 2.5\\nmg PO daily, which will be recommended as the home dose, per\\nmedicine.\\n\\nThe patient's post-op hematocrit dropped after his first\\nevacuation of right neck hematoma. He had received a total of 4\\nunits of packed red cells throughout his hospital course. His\\nhematocrit responded appropriately to transfusion each time, for\\na goal Hct > 25. Upon discharge, his hematocrit had been stable\\nat 32.6%. His WBC remained within normal limits throughout his\\nhospitalization. The patient was maintained on Clindamycin 600\\nmg IV Q8 while the right neck drains were in place to bulb\\nsuction. He is being discharged with 5 more days of PO\\nClindamycin.\\n\\nPROPHYLAXIS: Pneumatic compression boots were maintained in the\\npost-op period to prevent DVT/PE initially. The patient was\\nencouraged to ambulate twice daily. Famotidine was administered\\nfor GI prophylaxis given the steroid treatment.\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\nHome Medications:\\n- Citalopram 20 mg PO daily\\n- Trazadone 50 mg PO HS\\n- Metoprolol succinate 25 mg PO daily\\n- ASA 325 mg PO daily\\n\\nMedication on Transfer to MICU:\\n- Furosemide 20 mg IV ONCE\\n- Nitroglycerin SL 0.3 mg SL ONCE\\n- Chloraseptic Throat Spray 1 SPRY PO Q8H:PRN sore throat\\n- Acetaminophen 650 mg PO/NG Q6H:PRN pain\\n- Citalopram Hydrobromide 20 mg PO/NG DAILY\\n- Clindamycin 600 mg IV Q8H JP drain\\n- Trazadone 50 mg PO/NG HS\\n- Dilaudid 1-2mg PO Q4H:PRN pain\\n\\nDischarge Medications:\\n1.

Two days prior to admission,\\nshe was started on a prednisone taper and one day prior to\\nadmission she required oxygen at home in order to maintain\\noxygen saturation greater than 90%.  She has also been on\\nlevofloxacin and nebulizers, and was not getting better, and\\npresented to the [**Hospital1 18**] Emergency Room.\\n\\nIn the [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Room, her oxygen saturation was\\n100% on CPAP.  She was not able to be weaned off of this\\ndespite nebulizer treatment and Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV x2.\\n\\nReview of systems is negative for the following:  Fevers,\\nchills, nausea, vomiting, night sweats, change in weight,\\ngastrointestinal complaints, neurologic changes, rashes,\\npalpitations, orthopnea.  Is positive for the following:\\nChest pressure occasionally with shortness of breath with\\nexertion, some shortness of breath that is positionally\\nrelated, but is improved with nebulizer treatment.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\\n1. COPD.  Last pulmonary function tests in [**2117-11-3**]\\ndemonstrated a FVC of 52% of predicted, a FEV1 of 54% of\\npredicted, a MMF of 23% of predicted, and a FEV1:FVC ratio of\\n67% of predicted, that does not improve with bronchodilator\\ntreatment.  The FVC, however, does significantly improve with\\nbronchodilator treatment consistent with her known reversible\\nair flow obstruction in addition to an underlying restrictive\\nventilatory defect.  The patient has never been on home\\noxygen prior to this recent episode.  She has never been on\\nsteroid taper or been intubated in the past.\\n2. Lacunar CVA.  MRI of the head in [**2114-11-4**]\\ndemonstrates \"mild degree of multiple small foci of high T2\\nsignal within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres\\nas well as the pons, in the latter region predominantly to\\nthe right of midline.  The abnormalities, while nonspecific\\nin etiology, are most likely secondary to chronic\\nmicrovascular infarction.  There is no mass, lesion, shift of\\nthe normal midline strictures or hydrocephalus.  The major\\nvascular flow patterns are preserved.  There is moderate\\nright maxillary, moderate bilateral ethmoid, mild left\\nmaxillary, minimal right sphenoid, and frontal sinus mucosal\\nthickening.  These abnormalities could represent an allergic\\nor some other type of inflammatory process.  Additionally\\nnoted is a moderately enlarged subtotally empty sella\\nturcica\".\\n3.

The\\npatient is a prior smoker, but has not smoked in over 10\\nyears.  She has no known alcohol use and she is a full code.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAM AT TIME OF ADMISSION:  Blood pressure 142/76,\\nheart rate 100 and regular, respirations at 17-21, and 97%\\naxillary temperature.  She was saturating at 100% on CPAP\\nwith dry mucous membranes.  An elderly female in no apparent\\ndistress.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and\\naccommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Oropharynx\\ndifficult to assess due to CPAP machine.  No evidence of\\njugular venous pressure, however, the strap from the CPAP\\nmachine obscures the neck exam.  Cranial nerves II through\\nXII are grossly intact.  Neck is supple without\\nlymphadenopathy.  Heart exam:  Tachycardic, regular, obscured\\nby loud bilateral wheezing with increase in the expiratory\\nphase as well as profuse scattered rhonchi throughout the\\nlung fields.  Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,\\nnondistended, obese, no masses.  Mild edema of the lower\\nextremities without clubbing or cyanosis, no rashes.  There\\nis a right hand hematoma.  Strength is assessed as [**5-9**] in the\\nlower extremities, [**5-9**] in the upper extremities with a normal\\nmental status and cognition.\\n\\nLABORATORY STUDIES:  White count 19, hematocrit 41, platelets\\n300.  Chem-7:  127, 3.6, 88, 29, 17, 0.6, 143.  Troponin was\\nnegative.  CKs were negative times three.  Initial blood gas\\nshowed a pH of 7.4, pO2 of 66, pCO2 of 54.\\n\\nChest x-ray demonstrates a moderate sized hiatal hernia,\\nsegmental atelectasis, left lower lobe infiltrate versus\\nsegmental atelectasis.\\n\\nEKG shows normal sinus rhythm at 113 beats per minute, normal\\naxis, no evidence of ST-T wave changes.\\n\\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:\\n1. COPD/dyspnea/pneumonia:  The patient was initially placed\\non an aggressive steroid taper and admitted to the Medical\\nIntensive Care Unit due to her difficulty with oxygenation\\ndespite CPAP machine.  She was also given nebulizer\\ntreatments q.4h. as well as chest PT.  The nebulizers were\\nincreased to q.1h. due to the fact that she continued to have\\nlabored breathing.\\n\\nDue to persistent respiratory failure and labored breathing,\\nthe patient was intubated on [**2118-6-7**] in order to improve\\noxygenation, ventilation, and ability to suction.  A\\nbronchoscopy was performed on [**2118-6-7**], which demonstrated\\nmarked narrowing of the airways with expiration consistent\\nwith tracheomalacia.\\n\\nOn [**2118-6-9**], two silicone stents were placed, one in the left\\nmain stem (12 x 25 and one in the trachea 16 x 40) by Dr.\\n[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] under rigid bronchoscopy with general anesthesia.\\n\\nOn [**2118-6-11**], the patient was extubated to a cool mist shovel\\nmask and her oxygen was titrated down to 2 liters nasal\\ncannula at which time she was transferred to the medical\\nfloor.  On the medical floor, the steroids were weaned to off\\non [**2118-6-14**], and the patient was saturating at 97% on 2\\nliters, 92% on room air.\\n\\nOn [**2118-6-14**], the patient was seen again by the Interventional\\nPulmonology service, who agreed that she looked much improved\\nand recommended that she go to pulmonary rehabilitation with\\nfollowup within six weeks\\' time status post placement of\\nstents in respiratory failure.\\n\\n2. Cardiovascular:  The patient was ruled out for a MI.  She\\ndid have another episode on the medical floor of chest pain,\\nwhich showed no evidence of EKG changes and negative\\ntroponin, negative CKs x3.  She was continued on aspirin,\\nImdur, and diltiazem for rate control per her outpatient\\nregimen.\\n\\n3. Hypertension:  She was maintained on diltiazem and\\nhydrochlorothiazide with adequate blood pressure control and\\nnormalization of electrolytes.\\n\\n4. Hematuria:  The patient had intermittent hematuria likely\\nsecondary to Foley placement.  The Foley catheter was\\ndiscontinued on [**2118-6-14**].  She had serial urinalyses, which\\nwere all negative for signs of infection.\\n\\n5. Hyperglycemia:  Patient was placed on insulin-sliding\\nscale due to hyperglycemia, which was steroid induced.  This\\nworked quite well and her glucose came back to normal levels\\nonce the steroids were tapered to off.\\n\\n6. Leukocytosis:  Patient did have a profound leukocytosis of\\n20 to 22 during much of her hospital course.  As the steroids\\nwere tapered to off, her white blood cell count on [**2118-6-14**]\\nwas 15,000.  It was felt that the leukocytosis was secondary\\nto both steroids as well as question of a left lower lobe\\npneumonia.\\n\\n7. For the left lower lobe pneumonia, the patient had\\ninitially received a course of levofloxacin 500 p.o. q.d.\\nfrom [**2118-6-4**] to [**2118-6-10**].  This was restarted on [**2118-6-12**]\\nfor an additional seven day course given the fact that she\\nstill had the leukocytosis and still had marked rales at the\\nleft lower lobe.\\n\\n8. Hypothyroidism:  The patient was continued on outpatient\\nmedical regimen.\\n\\n9. Depression:  The patient was continued on Lexapro per\\noutpatient regimen.  It is recommended that she follow up\\nwith a therapist as an outpatient due to the fact that she\\ndid have a blunted affect throughout much of the hospital\\ncourse, and did appear clinically to be depressed.\\n\\n10. Prophylaxis:  She was maintained on proton-pump inhibitor\\nwith subQ Heparin.\\n\\n11. Sore throat:  The patient did have a sore throat for much\\nof the hospital course post extubation.  This was treated\\nwith Cepacol lozenges as well as KBL liquid (a solution\\ncontaining Kaopectate, Bismuth, and lidocaine) at bedtime.\\n\\n12. Communication/code status:  The patient was full code\\nthroughout her hospital course, and communication was\\nmaintained with the patient and her husband.\\n\\n13. Muscle weakness:  The patient did have profound muscle\\nweakness and was evaluated by Physical Therapy, and was found\\nto have impaired functional mobility, impaired\\nmusculoskeletal performance, impaired gas exchange, impaired\\nendurance, impaired ventilation, and needed help with supine\\nto sit.  However, she was able to tolerate sitting in a chair\\nfor approximately one hour.\\n\\nOn motor exam, her flexors and extensors of the lower\\nextremities were [**4-8**] at the knee, [**4-8**] at the ankle, [**4-8**] at\\nthe elbows, and [**4-8**] hips.  It was felt that this weakness was\\nmost likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy as well\\nas muscle atrophy secondary to deconditioning after a\\nprolonged hospital course.\\n\\n14. Speech/swallow:  The patient had a Speech and Swallow\\nevaluation showing no evidence of dysphagia, no evidence of\\nvocal cord damage status post tracheal stent placement.\\n\\nDISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient was able to oxygenate on\\nroom air at 93% at the time of discharge.  She was profoundly\\nweak, but was no longer tachycardic and had a normal blood\\npressure.  Her respirations were much improved albeit with\\ntransmitted upper airway sounds.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to [**Hospital1 **]\\nfor both pulmonary and physical rehabilitation.\\n\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\\n1. Levothyroxine 75 mcg p.o. q.d.\\n2. Citalopram 10 mg p.o. q.d.\\n3. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.\\n4. Fluticasone 110 mcg two puffs inhaled b.i.d.\\n5. Salmeterol Diskus one inhalation b.i.d.\\n6.
